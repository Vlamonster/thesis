The expected outcome of this research is a formally verified SMT solver, based on transition rules and implemented in
the Coq proof assistant. The solver will be proven to be sound, complete, and terminating.

This work will help bridge the gap between practical SMT solving and formal verification, offering a reliable,
mathematically verified tool for automated reasoning. Furthermore, it will lay the foundation for future work to refine
and implement more advanced verified solvers.
